<h1>Time to Quiz</h1>
    <p>In this project I wanted to design a sports quiz that calculated score by time left. Needing a count down timer with perimeters set that allow for penalties for incorrect answer. I created this application by using HTML, CSS, and javaScript. The data collect is posted after you are directed to high score page for results of other players.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
    <h3>Start Button</h3>
        <p>A start button is used to start the allotted time of 80 seconds to answer 8 questions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Questions range in difficulty, and for each incorrect answer there is a ten second run off. Similar to rules in football (staying in theme).</p>
    <h3>Append Pages</h3>
        <p>You move from page to page based on select function. Start button takes you to the quiz, answering the question takes you to the score page. Submitting you "autograph" takes you to the high score page</p>
